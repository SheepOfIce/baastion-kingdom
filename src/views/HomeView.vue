    <h1>Requirements</h1>

    <h3>Obsidian Donations</h3>
    
    <p>
      We require a minimum of 4,500 obsidian to be donated each week. This will only require getting one grade 2 obsidian node (650 obsidian) from
      Familiar Adventure every day. This will help us improve the kingdom which will then help you improve!
    </p>
    
    <h3>Prism Donations</h3>
    
    <p>
      Currently, there is no requirement for prism donations. However, once we can purchase more upgrades with prisms, there will likely be a
      requirement of 450 prisms per week so please prepare. Again, this will just be one grade 2 prism node (65 prisms) from Familiar Adventure
      every day.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Real-Life Commitments</h3>
    
    <p>
      With these requirements in place it is only possible to donate enough resources in 2 days (4,000 obsidian &amp; 300 diamonds on the first day,
      and 500 on the second day) so if you are offline for 6 days you will be removed from the kingdom to make space for new members.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      However, if you do have real-life commitments that prevent you from logging in enough to meet the donation requirements then please send me a
      message either in Discord or in-game. This way I know you plan to come back and can accommodate.
    </p>

    <h1>Discord</h1>
    
    <p>
      While not required, joining our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/x6K4BvJK6w" target="_blank">Discord server</a> will allow you to get
      important notifications much easier than in-game.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Additionally, Baastion is part of an alliance of several kingdoms. Once you are in our personal Discord server, you have the option of
      joining the alliance Discord server as well!

      Planned Updates
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      I plan on adding helpful functions to this website &amp; Discord in the future but please let me know if you have any further ideas as well!
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Kingdom events (such as Kingdom Defense or Kingdom Dungeon) events in Discord so you can get reminders.</li>
      <li>Set your weekly availability schedule to help with event planning.</li>
      <li>Vote for what kingdom resources will be spent on.</li>
      <li>
        Various game guides to help provide information on how the Kingdom functions &amp; how best to help.
        First one I am planning is Familiar Forest since there are requirements based on this.
      </li>
      <li>A nicer looking website &amp; Discord icon.</li>
    </ul>
